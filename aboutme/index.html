    <p>I have taken the jack of all trades master of none approach to my educaction, but while I work through the rest of whatever degree I land on I'm a substitute teacher.  I've been married almost 24 years and have 8 kids.  I love to hang out with my kids which is different now that half of the 8 are off to college.  I also like to read, sew, nap in a hammock, and play Spyro. </p>
    <p>I'm taking this class because we started a tree service over the summer and I'd love to be able to manage our website without paying for someone and our scout troop does a mulch fundraiser that also has a website. If I like it I might pursue it professionally.  I have an associates already and originally wanted to teach high school chemistry, but having subbed for a bit now I'm not sure I still want to be a teacher so I'm shopping around for what to finish my bachelors in.</p>
    <p>I was raised in the church, baptized when I was 8.  I have a memory of a night a few days after I was baptized when I couldn't sleep and I got out of my bed to pray to be forgiven for the things I had done wrong since my baptism and I remember feeling such peace and getting back in bed and falling asleep.  I believe that we build our testimonies on moments like that and we should treasure them and write them down and read them often. They don't always keep us from doing dumb stuff - especially in our teens - but they give us a place to return to when we come to ourselves. I love the gospel, sometimes I get a glimpse of what I would be like or my life would be like without it and I thank Heavenly Father that my parents both joined the church in college.</p>
