            Mulch is any protective ground cover laid over the the soil in your yard of flower and garden beds. <br><br>  Mulch improves the look of your yard, but also serves several practical purposes.  Mulch improves moisture retention in the soil and regulates soil temperature, so your plants stay healthier.  Mulch that is made of natural woods biodegrades and adds nutrients to the soil, also helping your plants.  By covering the soil, mulch prevents soil erosion, which can be especially important around your foundation.  Mulch also suppresses weeds by blocking direct sunlight to the soil.

        <p id="how_much">
            To find out how much mulch you need, measure the area that you want to cover. Make sure that you include areas under shrubs or trees.  A good rule of thumb is that a 10x10 area will need at least 9 bags of mulch.

        <p id="use_calculator"> Some tips for curved our wavy areas. <br> <br> The area of a circle is about 12% (say 10% for easier math) smaller than a similar square.  To mulch around a tree, measure like it's a square and then subtract 10%.  For a 10 x 10 area, that would be 90 sq ft. <br> <br> For a wavy edge, find the width of the wavy part, multiply by length, then divide in half. <br> <br> Once you know the amount of area you need to cover, you can use this Mulch Calculator</p>
