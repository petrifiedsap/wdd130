      <h3>About Mulch</h3>
      <p>
        About mulch
Mulch is any protective ground cover laid over the the soil in your yard of flower and garden beds.  Mulch improves the look of your yard, but also serves several practical purposes.  Mulch improves moisture retention in the soil and regulates soil temperature, so your plants stay healthier.  Mulch that is made of natural woods biodegrades and adds nutrients to the soil, also helping your plants.  By covering the soil, mulch prevents soil erosion, which can be especially important around your foundation.  Mulch also suppresses weeds by blocking direct sunlight to the soil.    
To find out how much mulch you need, measure the area that you want to cover. Then use this mulch calculator Mulch Calculator  A good rule of thumb is that a 10x10 area will need at least 8 bags of mulch.

        Our troop
Troop 27 B and G operates out of Plano, TX.  Our troop participates in many scouting activities during the year.  Our fundraisers pay for those activities, especially our summer camps!  Our younger scouts go to Camp Hale in Oklahoma, where they work on merit badges they need for rank advancement and learn fun things like sailing, robotics, or welding.  Our older scouts go on high adventure where they do things like summit mountains, backpack across country, raft river rapids, zipline across canyons, and learn to ride ATVs.
2022 -  Z-base - Our troop did a 7 day trek where we canoed across a lake, shot black powder rifles at the old west range, conquered a 4 story climbing tower with zipline, shot clay pigeons at an 18 station shotgun course, got ASI ATV rider training and did a trail ride, and knee-boarded at the cable-wake park.
2023 - Philmont 12 day trek 
2024 - Colorado high adventure - Camping and sand sledding at Great Sand Dunes National Park, all-day rafting on the Arkansas river with class IV rapids, Multiple level ropes course and zipline course, camping and back-country hiking to the bottom of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison, hiking to the summit of Mt Elbert the highest peak in Colorado.
